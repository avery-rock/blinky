This project seeks to answer a simple question: if you have more than two eyeballs and close some but not all of them, are you blinking or winking? 

Does the fraction of eyes closes matter? How about symmetry? Duration? 

Do we need another, entirely different word to capture previously unimagined combinations of open and closed eyes? 

This simple code generates .gif animations of black and white grids of cartoon eyeballs that open and close randomly. Their behaviors and rendering can be controlled to produce the desired effect overall. By default, a single .gif file called "eyeballs.gif" will be placed in the current directory.
